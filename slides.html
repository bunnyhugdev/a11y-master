        #What exactly *is* a website?

        A web**site** is made up of one or more web **pages**, and files (like images and HTML documents) organized in folders.

        The HTML & CSS code that we will be writing today will be read by a web browser and presented to the user.

        It's important to remember that many of us operate and experience the web in very different ways, but everyone should be able to access the same information. That's what accessibility is all about!

        (a + 11 letters + y)

        ## Who are we taking into consideration?

        Users who are visually impaired or blind, hard of hearing or deaf, the elderly, non-Native English speakers and/or of varying literacy levels, users who are mobility impaired.

        Situational disabilities (eg. sprained wrist, pupils dialated for an eye exam), slow/spotty internet/data connection, people in a hurry, people with large fingers...
        
        When we focus conscientiously on the needs of certain kinds of people, we are in fact learning how to design better websites for everyone!

        #Barriers

        A barrier is anything that keeps someone with a disability from fully participating in all aspects of society because of their disability.

        **Attitude** is perhaps the most difficult barrier to overcome because it’s hard to change the way people think or behave. Ideas formed about the person because of stereotypes or a lack of understanding. Some people may feel that they could offend the individual with a disability by offering help, or they ignore or avoid people with disabilities altogether. Remember, attitude is a major barrier that’s within our power to change.

        **Architectural** or structural barriers may result from design elements of a building such as stairs or doorways. Information and communication barriers can make it difficult for people to receive or convey information. Things like small print size, low colour contrast, confusing design and use of unclear language can create barriers.

        **Technology**, or lack of it, can prevent people from accessing information. Everyday tools like computers, telephones and other aids can present barriers if they are not designed with accessibility in mind.

        **Systemic** an organization's policies, practices and procedures that restrict people with disabilities, often unintentionally

        #Canadian laws

        AODA stands for **Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act**. It was enacted in 2005 by the government of Ontario to improve accessibility standards for Ontarians with physical and mental disabilities to all public establishments by 2025. Ontario is the first province in Canada to pass such a law, and it covers all areas of life travel, law, safety, employment, education, recreation and of course, technology!

        Manitoba (2013), Nova Scotia (2017), British Columbia (2018) followed suit and enacted similar legislation in their respective provinces.

        The federal government introduced Bill C-81, the Accessible Canada Act, in 2018  to "identify, remove and prevent" accessibility barriers in federally regulated private sector (transportation, broadcasting, telecommunications and finance)

        #How it applies to the web - WCAG

        WCAG stands for **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines** and provides standards to keep the internet accessible to *everyone*, no matter what modifications they may require. These guidelines were developed by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/w3c-process/).

        The goal isn't "all or nothing", however — every improvement you are able to make will help the cause of accessibility!

        WCAG guidelines are based upon four basic principles: **perceivable, operable, understandable**, and **robust**. Let's examine each of these principles...

      <script type="text/template">
        #Perceivable

        >"Information and user interface components must be presentable to users **in ways they can perceive**"

        * Any non-text content, like images, audio or video, have a text alternative
        * Information, structure, and relationships are "programmatically determined" (using HTML)
        * Understanding and operating content do not *rely solely* on sensory characteristics like colour, shape, size, location or sound
          * Understanding and operating content does not rely on states such as hover or mouseover

        Components = [tabs](https://jqueryui.com/tabs/), [accordions](https://jqueryui.com/accordion/), pop-up windows, chat windows

        * Make all functionality available from a keyboard
        * Provide users enough time to read content
        * Any moving, blinking or scrolling information that triggers automatically includes a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it
        * Users have the ability to pause, stop, or control functionality and auto-updating feeds
        * Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures ([flash and redflash thresholds](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#general-thresholddef))

        * The default human language of each Web page is programmatically determined (using HTML)
        * Meaning of abbreviations/acronyms is available (also using HTML)
        * Careful consideration when using idioms and jargon, more advanced than the lower secondary education level reading ability
        * Labels or instructions are provided when content requires user input
        * Error messages are described to the user in text when filling out a form
          * They should be specific to the input, like "please provide a valid email address" as opposed to something generic like "required field"

        "User agents" = devices (tablets, laptops, mobile phones, smart TVs, watched)
                      = browsers (Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, mobile browsers)
        "Assistive technologies" = screenreaders, eye or head trackers, joysticks, trackballs, on-screen keyboards, etc.

        This area is really concerned with valid, error-free HTML:
        * Elements have complete start and end tags
        * Form elements, links, components and states are programmatically determined (eg. These are tabs, and this tab is currently active)

        #Accessing websites and web pages

        When we want to view a specific page on a website, we provide a *URL* to the browser.

        ```xml
        https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/about/
        ```

        The browser uses the URL to determine *how* and *where* to find the files that we're interested in. For example, the URL above would take us to the `about` page of the Canada Learning Code website.

    <!--section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #More about URLs

        URLs typically contain the following pieces:

        - `scheme` - This tells the browser *how* to find the file.
        - `host` - This is the name of the website itself. It tells the browser *generally* where the file can be found (kind of like a home address).
        - `path` - This tells the browser *specifically* where the file can be found. If the `host` is the home address, the `path` is the name of the person we're looking for, and which room they're in!

        ```xml
        <scheme>//<host>/<path>/
        ```

        #Software: Screen Readers

        Screen readers are software programs that allow blind or visually impaired users to read the text of a web page using text-to-speech or braille display. The user can sends commands using their keyboard to instruct the synthesizer to read or spell a word, read a line or full screen of text, find a string of text on the screen, announce the location of the computer's cursor or focused item, and so on. Prices range from free to $1,200.

        ##Should I learn how to use a screen reader?
        
        Most experts do not recommend that a site owner or developer try to learn how to use a screen reader - here's why!

        A sighted person will not truly be able to emulate what it is like for a visually impaired person to use a website. If you can see the screen, you will be reacting to spatial cues that are not available to visually impaired visitors. It's always best, if possible, to conduct user testing with users who actually have the disabilities you're developing for.

        #Hardware: Pointer devices and keyboards

        For persons with disabilities, your typical keyboard and mouse/trackpad may not be suitable. Special hardware exists to provide alternatives to a mouse or trackpad:

        * Alternative keyboards - keyboards that are designed to be used with one hand
        * Wands and sticks - worn on the head, held in the mouth or strapped to the chin and used to press keys on the keyboard
        * Joysticks - manipulated by hand, feet, chin, etc.
        * Sip-and-puff systems - activated by inhaling or exhaling
        * Electronic pointing devices - used to control the cursor on the screen without use of hands. They can use ultrasound, infrared beams, eye movements, nerve signals, or brain waves

        Tags usually come in pairs &mdash; an opening tag and a closing tag &mdash; to *wrap* the content.  Note the closing tag has a forward slash (`/`).

        ```
        <tag> opening tag --- closing tag </tag>
        ```

        HTML *tags* describe the content inside of them to the web browser or assitive technologies.

        ```

        Nested tags create a family tree-like relationship, often referred to as *parent* and *child* nodes.

        The inner tag is the child of the outer tag.

        But for us, using whitespace through indentation (tabs) will makes HTML easier to read. When nesting a tag, add one tab space.

        #Class Exercise #1: Editing your project's HTML page

        1. In the text editor, open `index.html` (**File** > **Save**)
        1. In *between* the `<title></title>` tags, add a *page title* that reflects the content of your webpage. Example:
          ```
          <title>Laura Ipsum | Digital Designer & Developer</title>
          ```
        1. Open `index.html` in the browser.
          * go to Windows Explorer or Finder
          * navigate to the **llc-a11y-master > project** folder
          * double click on **index.html** to open it in your default browser
          <br><span class="note">(If Chrome is not your default, right-click/two-finger tap on **index.html** and choose **Open With > Chrome**)</span>

        Can you see where the `title` tag content is displaying?

        1. Edit the content between any of the other HTML tags to customize the content on the page. Remember to save your changes in the text editor, and then refresh the page in your web browser to see the changes.

        #HTML5 Structural Elements

        HTML5 introduced new tags to better describe blocks of content such as `<header>`, `<footer>` and `<section>`. (There are many more.)

        **Good for SEO** — search engines give more importance to keywords inside headings, links, etc., than keywords included in non-semantic tags like `<div>`s, etc., so your documents will be more indexable.
        **Good for screenreader users** - screenreaders read those tags out as the user progresses through the content, notifying them what is a header, footer, etc.

        1. Inside of the `main` tag, add two `section` tags and give each of them a unique `class` attribute. We will use these later to give each section their own styles with CSS
        1. Create a `footer` tag and add at least 1 paragraph inside of it.

        #Headings

        HTML heading tags define the main subjects throughout the page. They are similar to the headlines and taglines of articles in a newspaper.

        There are six headings tags ranging from `<h1>` to `<h6>` used to describe the *hierarchy* of the page structure. To decide which heading to use, think about how you would arrange an essay outline.

        Most screenreaders allow you to skip through all headings on the page, like a table of contents, to find specific content.

        The order of headings is important as it allows non-visual users (and search engine bots) to understand the importance and hierarchy of content on the page. Heading levels should not be skipped!

        >Avoid typing in all caps! Some screen readers will read text in all caps letter by letter. If you want a heading to appear in all uppercase letters, this can be done with CSS!

        **Paragraphs**: whether it&#39;s one sentence or more, each paragraph needs its own pair of `<p></p>` tags.

        ```xml
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

        <p>This is a longer paragraph. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Non vero dolor expedita quasi reiciendis minus unde sapiente id eveniet saepe officia quibusdam aspernatur, sint voluptate ipsam ex magni. Aliquam, ex!</p>

        If you need to start text on a new line, you can use the self-closing `br` tag. That means no closing `</br>` tag is necessary:

        #Tips for writing content on the web

        * Text should be as simple and clear as possible. Less is more. Take into consideration non-native English/French speaking users and avoid using too much industry jargon (depending on your audience)
        * Start each page and sub-section with the most important information. *“Don’t bury the lede”*
        * Break up large paragraphs with bulleted or numbered lists where appropriate (HTML for this on the next slide). Lists are easier to skim then paragraphs.
        * Avoid typing in all caps - some screen readers will uppercase rest letter by letter. If you like all caps stylistically, we can do that using CSS, but in the HTML they should be written in regular case.
        * When abbreviations are used in text, use the HTML `<abbr>` tag to provide the long form, like this:
          * *The `<abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>` was founded in 1948.*

        #Lists

        **Ordered lists** are used to list items in a specific order. Two elements are required, an ordered list tag, `ol` and a list item tag, `li`:

        ```xml
        <p>Getting self-serve yogurt</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Take a cup</li>
          <li>Fill cup with yogurt</li>
          <li>Add toppings</li>
          <li>Weigh and pay</il>
        </ol>
        ```
        With CSS, we can change this from appearing as a numbered list. We could use letters a-z, roman numerals, and more.
        
        Use **unordered lists** for list items that do not need to be ordered sequentially. The syntax is the same as the ordered list, but use the unordered list tag `<ul>` instead:

        ```xml
        <ul>
          <li>bread</li>
          <li>olive oil</li>
          <li>bananas</li>

        # Hyperlinks

        A hyperlink references data, such as a web page or document, that the user can follow.

        Use the anchor tag, `<a>` to create the link. It also needs an `href` attribute to provide information for the location of the resource.

        The example below includes an *absolute* path to the Ladies Learning Code homepage.

        ```xml
        <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code</a>
        ```

        To set the link to open in a new window, add a second attribute, `target`.
        ```xml
        <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com" target="_blank">Ladies Learning Code</a>
        ```

        Here's the syntax for an email link:
        ```xml
        <a href="mailto:hello@myemail.com">hello@myemail.com</a>
        ```

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Tips for accessible hyperlinks

        * Be sure the link text describes its purpose and destination. If you read the link on its own, without the paragraph surrounding it, it should be clear where the user will go. For instance, rather than writing:
          `<a href="annual-report.pdf">Click here</a> to link to read our annual report`

          consider something like:
          `<a href="annual-report.pdf">Read our annual report</a>.`

        * If a link is going to open in a new tab, the user needs to be aware of this behaviour. You can write this out in the link, or do something like this:

        #Paths

        Even though today's project only has one page, it can include  different types of content.

        Some of that content lives directly within the page itself (ie. the text), and some of it may live elsewhere (eg. in the images folder, on other websites, etc.).

        When we want to display some content that lives *outside* of the current page, we have to tell the browser where to find it. This information is called a `path`.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide project" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Types of Paths

        Paths allow the browser to find, retrieve, and display external resources such as images, CSS/JS files, and even other pages.

        There are two different types of paths:

        * `Relative` - These tell the browser how to get from the current page to the external resource.
        * `Absolute` - These tell the browser *exactly* where the external resource can be found online.

        If relative paths are like directions, an absolute path is like a home address.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide project" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Relative Paths

        **We use relative paths when we're trying to make a connection between two resources on the same website.**

        Relative paths start from the location of the current page, and tell the browser which folders should be looked in to find the external resource.

        ```xml
        images/backgrounds/dark/dark-background-1.jpg
        ```

        We'll be using relative paths to add images shortly!

    <section class="slide project" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Absolute Paths

        **We use absolute paths to request resources that live *outside* of our own website (eg. elsewhere online).**

        ```xml
        // Image
        http://website.com/images/image-1.jpg

        // CSS
        https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.css
        ```

        Absolute paths start with a protocol (ie. `http` or `https`), followed by the location of the resource. It's usually not necessary to include the `www` before the domain.

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Images: Self-closing tags

        Self-closing tags don't format content or require a closing tag. They are used to embed objects onto the page; they *are* the content!

        Images use a self-closing tag. It also requires the `src` *attribute* to tell the browser the location of the image file.

        ```
       <img src="images/image-file.jpg">

        ```

        `alt` is another attribute that is added to images to provide *alternative text* to visually impaired web visitors using screen readers.

        ```
        <img src="images/image-file.jpg" alt="kitten">

        ```

        The `alt` attribute is also helpful when image does not load:
        <img src="" alt="kitten">

        #Accessible images

        ##Criteria for Alt Text

        * Should be short and succinct 
        * Should not include the words “image of” or “photo of” - the screenreader will indicate that this element is an image when it comes across the `img` tag. 
          * Words like “illustration of” or “diagram of” may be helpful to some users if it provides context
        * If the image itself has text in it, like a logo, the `alt` text *must* include that text!

        ##More tips for Accessible images

        * Large images can cause your site to slow down sigificantly. Performance is a major consideration when creating a website - if your site is too slow, users are much more likely to leave
          * Try a free service like [tinyjpg](https://tinyjpg.com/) to compress your images before you upload them to a website to decrease the file size

        #But wait - is this video accessible?

        ##Captions - nice to have
        Captions are text versions of audio content synchronized with video. They’re crucial for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, and can also be helpful for non-native English speakers. When captions are added to YouTube videos, they can be indexed by search engines, allowing more potential viewers to find your content.

        Read more on [YouTube’s guide to adding your own subtitles & closed captions](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796?hl=en&ref_topic=7296214) to videos. You can also use YouTube’s automatic captioning function and make edits to them as needed.

        ##Transcript - essential
        Text transcripts allow anyone that cannot access audio or video content to read text instead. This is required for accessibility, and helpful for users who have a slow internet connection, or are otherwise unable to watch a video at that given time. Additionally, it lets users search the text for specific words to find a quote from your video.

        The transcript should be a plain .txt file, so it is not dependent on software like Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Word. Read more on [YouTube’s Tips for creating a transcript](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734799?hl=en) to see examples of how to format dialogue and incorporate background sounds.

        #Exercise #4: Video transcript (15mins)

        1. Create a plain text file named `transcript.txt` in the root folder of your project (a sibling to the `index.html` file). Type out at least the first few sentences of audio in the video that you've selected.
        1. Add a hyperlink in your `index.html` directly below the `iframe` code from Youtube that will open your transcript file.
        1. Add any additional images as needed - don't forget the `alt` attributes!
        1. Personalize more of the content if you have not done so already.

        Your page should look something like this: <!-- .element: class="note" -->[exercise-4.html](project/reference/exercise-4.html)

        <!-- .element: class="note" -->**Bonus exercise**
        Square images are better for the Part 2 exercises. You can crop and resize them using this free tool, [Pixlr](http://apps.pixlr.com/editor/). Between 200px - 400px is best.

        #Tips for making Accessible PDFs

        We've talked about accessible *web content* so far, but often we will have files that will be linked to in your site. Those files need to be accessible as well!

        If a PDFs is simply scanned images of paper documents, versus PDFs generated from source files such as Microsoft Word (meaning you cannot select the text in the document), these are **wholly inaccessibile** and should be converted to a web format (HTML or text).

        Please note that all of the settings on the next slide should be set when the PDF is being authored in Adobe Acrobat Pro. Some of these tools may not be available in the free Acrobat Reader.

        #Making Accessible PDFs

        1. **Set the document title:** Choose File > Properties > Description. Enter a title in the ‘Title’ text box. Click ‘Initial View’, and then choose ‘Document Title’ from the ‘Show’ drop-down list. Click OK to close the Description dialog box.
        1. **Set the document language:**  Go to File > Properties > Advanced, and in the ‘Reading Options’ section select the language from the drop-down list.
        1. Prevent **security settings** from interfering with screen readers by allowing text to be copied, printed or extracted: Go to File > Properties > Security. Choose ‘No Security’ from the ‘Security Method’ drop-down list. Click OK and close the ‘Document Properties’ dialog box.
        1. If your document has more than 21 pages, **bookmarks** are required. Follow [Adobe’s guide to creating Bookmarks](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/page-thumbnails-bookmarks-pdfs.html#about_bookmarks)
        1. Ensure the document has a **high enough contrast** for users with colour blindness. Go to the Edit > Preferences, select ‘Accessibility’ in the left menu, and select the ‘Use High-Contrast colors’ option:
        [screenshot]
        1. Just like we do for images on the web, Alt Text must be applied to images used in PDFs. Follow the instructions in this guide depending on the software you are using to author the PDF.

        1. Click on the dropdown arrow and ‘Add Shortcut’. You will now see an Accessibility item appear in the right menu. Click on that heading, and then select ‘Full Check’:

        1. In the dialogue box that appears, keep all options selected and click the ‘Start Checking’ button. A list of any issues will appear in a column on the left of the PDF. Right click on any remaining issue and select ‘Fix’ from the dropdown to resolve that issue.

        #Referencing CSS

        Today, we&#39;ll be creating a separate style sheet file for the CSS.  To create a stylesheet, just name the file with a `.css` file extension.

        The style sheet is then referenced within the `<head>` of the HTML document (different tag from `<header>`).

        Use `<link>` tag and two *attributes*, `rel` and `href`.

        ```
        <head>
          <title>Page Title</title>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

        In the current project HTML document, the red lines in the example below represent the outlines of all the elements.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/box-borders-example.jpg)

        Note the spacing between the elements on your page such as the headings and paragraphs. That's the default `margin` and `padding` for those elements.

        * **width** - can set a specific width

        Setting the value to "0" will *remove* any default space and any positive value will *add* space.

        Margin can also use negative values. Padding cannot.

        (Make sure the box model fix from the previous slide has been added to<!-- .element: class="note" --> **styles.css** before proceeding. Also, use the amount of space that looks good to you & use the examples below as a guide.)

        Add padding to all the portions of the page so the content is not squished to the edge and has consistent styling.

        Combine the selectors to target them all at the same time.

        ```
        header,
        section,
        footer {
          padding: 100px 150px;
        }

      <script type="text/template">
        #Class Exercise #7 - Spacing

        Notice the white space around the edge of the page? That's default space in the `body` element. Reset it by setting the values to 0.

        ```
        body {
          margin: 0;
          padding: 0;
        }
        ```

        Use `margin` to adjust the default space around the  `<h1>` and `<h2>` tag.  (You can *inspect the element* using the dev tools to see the default margin.)

        ```
        h1, h2 {
          margin: 0; /* removes default space */
        }
        ```

        #Descendant selectors

        Descendant selectors are used to select an element that is a descendant (nested tag) of another element.

        This is useful when targeting elements inside of a specific block of content (e.g. an `h1` in the `header`).

        Note the space in *between* each selector. This is a requirement.

        ```css
        p a {
          /* targets only anchor link tags nested inside of a p tag */
        }
        ul li a {
          /* targets a link nested in a list item in an unordered list */
        }

        #Descendant selectors

        **Pro tip!** Just like [Inception](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/), avoid going more than three levels.

        ```
        nav ul li a {
          /* NOOOOOOOOOOO */
        }
        ```

        You can skip a level but specificity rules apply.

        For example, `nav ul li a` would override `nav a` because it&#39;s more specific.

        It&#39;s generally better to start with generic selectors and make them more specific, as needed.

        # Class Exercise #9: Style the header

        Let's add some specific styles to the header, to set it apart from the rest of the page.  We can't use `h1` or `h2` by itself since it will select all of them on the page, so use *descendant selectors* instead.

        ```xml
        <header>
          <h1>Hi! I'm Laura Ipsum.</h1>
          <h2>I'm a digital designer and developer with a penchant for gourmet doughnuts.</h2>
        </header>
        ```

        ```
        header h1 {
          font-size: 100px;
        }
        header h2 {
          font-size: 32px;
        }
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Class Exercise #9: Style the header

        Next, let's highlight some keywords in the header (e.g. name).

        The semantic HTML meaning of the `<strong>` tag is to give importance to the text, so be sure to use it only for important text.

        ```
        <h1>Hi! I'm <strong>Laura Ipsum</strong>.</h1>
        <h2>I'm a digital <strong>designer</strong> and <strong>developer</strong> with a penchant for gourmet doughnuts.</h2>
        ```
        Now it can also be used to add CSS. If you want this style to be available anytime the `<strong>` tag is used, then there's no need to use a descendant selector.

        <!-- .element: class="note" -->**Pro tip!** Make sure the strong tag is used **semantically**, not just as a hook for styling!

        ```
        strong {
          color: #9D6381;
        }
        ```
        Color reference: <!-- .element: class="note" --><span style="background:#9D6381;padding:0 5px;">#9D6381</span>

        # Building a web page in blocks

        When building a web page, it's best to start with the HTML structure, then add CSS styles from general styles to more specific styles.

        But as you may have already noticed, there's no clear cut path for what to build first.  It often takes a step by step approach.

        To avoid CSS specificity issues, let's go over some general advice for using the selectors covered so far.

        #CSS Selectors: Best Practices

        **HTML element selectors:**  Use this to apply a style to all or *most* of that particular element on the page.  (e.g. all links on the page).

        ```
        a {
          color: red;
        }
        ```

        **Descendant selectors:** Use this to apply a style to a specific element within another element. (e.g. Only links within the navigation)

        ```
        nav a {
          color: blue;
        }
        ```

        **Class selectors:**  Use this to apply a style to an element that is not specific to an  HTML element, only the class.  (e.g. a portion of the page that uses the same HTML tag as another page block)

        ```
        .about {
          color: green;
        }

        #Stacked elements

        By default, most HTML elements are *block* level elements. This means they display stacked on top of each other and take up 100% width, in the order of how it is written.

        ```
        <p>element 1</p>
        <p>element 2</p>
        <p>element 3</p>
        ```
        The above HTML example renders as:

        <div class="example">
          <p>element 1</p>
          <p>element 2</p>
          <p>element 3</p>

        #Block vs Inline

        If we look at the previous box outline example again, notice that regardless of the number of characters, the content in the heading tags stack on top of each other.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/box-borders-example.jpg)
        <!-- ![](framework/img/workshop/box-borders-stack.png) -->

        Links are an example of *inline* elements, which sit side by side, in a line.  That's why you can add a link *within* a paragraph and not disrupt the flow of the text.

        Even though block elements such as headings & paragraphs by default display stacked on top of each other, there are ways to align block level elements using CSS.

      <p> Use the <code>float</code> property with a value of <code>left</code> or <code>right</code> to align the element to either side. Any element after the floated element will move up beside it. Let's try it out in the example below.</p>

        Then float the image (right or left).  Also, add space between the image and text using `margin`.

        There are two ways to declare the `background` property.

        /* shorthand */
        background: url(folder-name/image-file.jpg);

        Since it&#39;s inside of the **css** folder, the file path needs to reflect that.
        Use `../` to indicate that the directory needs to move *up* and *out* of the containing folder.

        ```css
        background: url(../images/image-file.jpg);
        ```

        # Background styles & the x-axis

        Every time an HTML element is nested, the elements are stacked in layers, kind of like a sandwich!

        ![](framework/img/workshop/graphical-z-index.gif)<!-- .element: class="left" -->
        </div>

        If a background image/colour is added to `body`, it will appear *behind* the nested elements (header, sections and footer).

        # Background Property

        If the image is smaller than the width of your browser window, it will repeat by default. We can change that with the `no-repeat` value like this:

        ```
        body { /* longhand */
          background-image: url(../images/buildings.jpg);
          background-repeat: no-repeat;
        }
        ```
        ```
        body { /* shorthand */
          background: url(../images/buildings.jpg) no-repeat;
        }
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Class Exercise #11: background

        Let&#39;s add the below sample code to our project, one value at a time, to see how each property works.

        ```
        body { /* longhand */
          background-image: url('../images/buildings.jpg');
          background-repeat: no-repeat;
          background-attachment: fixed;
          background-size: cover;
        }
        ```
        ```
        body { /* shorthand */
          background: url(../images/buildings.jpg) no-repeat fixed;
          background-size: cover;
        }
        ```

        ---
        ###Pro tip!

        Note that `background-size` is the longhand property. To include it in the shorthand style, it **must** be included after `background-position`, separated with the `/` character. In this case, it may be less error prone to just add it via the longhand property. More about background [here](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background/) and [here](http://www.carsonshold.com/2013/02/css-background-sizecover-doesnt-like-fixed-positioning/).

        # Opaque background Styles

        The image adds some pizzazz but now it's hard to read the text!

        Remember RGB colour values?  Use this instead of hex or keyword values to set an opacity to a background colour.

        Most online colour resources will have all the different types of values listed, or use image editing software like Photoshop.

        Or a quick online search almost always ends up with a solution like this tool right here: <http://hex.colorrrs.com>!

        The LLC project uses <span style="background:#612940;padding:0 5px;color: white;">#612940</span> which coverts to `rgb(97,41,64)`.

        # Class Exercise #11: background

        Use `rgba()` as the value to create this effect. The values must be declared using this syntax:

        ```css
        rgba(r value, g value, b value, alpha transparency percentage)
        ```
        ```css
        .about {
          background: rgba(97, 41, 64, 0.95);
        }
        ```
        The closer to 1 the alpha transparency value is, the more solid the colour will appear.

        Here are a couple of ideas for furthering your project.

        1. use icon fonts instead of images for the social icons
          * Try [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icon fonts
        1. add metadata to improve your site's Search Engine Optimization- [info here](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/79812?hl=en)

      #Getting your site online

      You will need to register a domain name and purchase hosting. Here are some suggestions:

      * [dreamhost.com](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?2085384) - domains and hosting
      * [hover.com](http://hover.com/ladiescode) - domains

      Why keep your domains and hosting separate?<!-- .element: class="note" --> [Learn more about Hover](http://ladieslearningcode.com/getting-hosted-domains-with-hover/).

      You will also need to upload your files to your hosting server. You will need some info usually provided by your hosting service provider: FTP Address, Username, Password.

      Here's a tutorial getting your files online using FileZilla: [FileZilla Client Tutorial](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_Client_Tutorial_%28en%29)
