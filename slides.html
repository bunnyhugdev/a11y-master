        #What exactly *is* a website?

        A web**site** is made up of one or more web **pages**, and files (like images and HTML documents) organized in folders.

        The HTML & CSS code that we will be writing today will be interpreted by a web browser and presented to the user.

        Some users operate and experience the web in very different ways than what we may be accustomed to, but everyone should be able to access the same information. That's what accessibility is all about!

        ## Who are we taking into consideration?

        Users who are visually impaired or blind, hard of hearing or deaf, the elderly, non-Native English speakers, users who are mobility impaired.
        
        When we focus conscientiously on these needs, you'll start to notice we are actually designing better websites for everybody!

        #Barriers

        A barrier is anything that keeps someone with a disability from fully participating in all aspects of society.

        **Attitude** is perhaps the most difficult barrier, but one that's completely within our power to change! Stereotypes form about people because of a lack of information.

        **Architectural** - communication barriers making it difficult to receive or convey information. Small print size, low colour contrast, confusing design and use of unclear language

        **Technology**, or lack of it, can prevent people from accessing information. Everyday tech tools can present barriers if they are not designed with accessibility in mind.

        **Systemic** an organization's policies, practices and procedures that restrict people with disabilities, often unintentionally

        AODA - **Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act**, 2005
        Enacted by government of Ontario

        * To improve accessibility standards for Ontarians with physical and mental disabilities to all public sector establishments by 2025.

        Manitoba (2013), Nova Scotia (2017) and British Columbia (2018) followed suit and enacted similar legislation in their respective provinces with varying timelines to acheive their goals.

        Bill C-81: **the Accessible Canada Act**, 2018
        Federal government

        * "identify, remove and prevent" accessibility barriers in federally regulated private sector (transportation, broadcasting, telecommunications and finance)

        #How it applies to the web - WCAG

        WCAG - **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines**
        * Provides a set of international standards to keep the internet accessible to *everyone*
          * may require modification
        * Guidelines were developed by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/w3c-process/).
        * AODA is the only provincial act that requires compliance with WCAG

        The goal isn't "all or nothing" — every improvement you are able to make will help the cause

        WCAG is based upon 4 principles: **perceivable, operable, understandable**, and **robust**. Let's examine each of these principles...
      </script>

      <script type="text/template">
        #Perceivable

        >"Information and user interface components must be presentable to users **in ways they can perceive**"

        * Any non-text content (images, audio or video) needs a text alternative
        * Understanding and operating doesn't *rely solely* on sensory characteristics (colour, shape, size, location or sound)
          * don't rely on hover or mouseover (touchscreens)

        * Accessible through use of a keyboard
        * Have enough time to read before content changes

        * Careful consideration when using idioms and insider jargon
        * Labels or instructions are present and clear
        * Error messages are descriptive and useful
          * "please provide a valid email address" is better than "required field"

        * devices (tablets, laptops, mobile phones, smart TVs, watched)
        * browsers (Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, mobile browsers)

        ## Assistive technologies

        #Accessing websites and web pages

        When we want to view a specific page on a website, we provide a URL to the browser to determine *how* and *where* to find the files:

        ```xml
        https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/about/
        ```

        We're going to be working on a file stored on our computer, which will look something like this:

        ```xml
        file:///C:/Users/YourName/Desktop/llc-a11y-master/project/index.html

        #More about URLs

        URLs typically contain the following pieces:

        - `scheme` - This tells the browser *how* to find the file.
        - `host` - This is the name of the website itself. It tells the browser *generally* where the file can be found (kind of like a home address).
        - `path` - This tells the browser *specifically* where the file can be found. If the `host` is the home address, the `path` is the name of the person we're looking for, and which room they're in!

        ```xml
        <scheme>//<host>/<path>/
        ```

        The main functionality of the [browser](http://browsehappy.com) is to present a *web resource* in the browser window.

        Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and dev tools for a better experience.

        In [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/) (and in other browsers), you can view the source of *any* web page. Right-click / two-finger tap anywhere on the browser and select **View Web Source**. That&rsquo;s HTML!

        Tags usually come in pairs &mdash; an opening tag and a closing tag &mdash; to *wrap* the content.  Note the closing tag has a forward slash (`/`).

        ```
        <tag> opening tag --- closing tag </tag>

        HTML *tags* describe the content inside of them to the web browser or assitive technologies.

        ```

        Nested tags create a family tree-like relationship, often referred to as *parent* and *child* nodes.

        The inner tag is the child of the outer tag.

        But for us, using whitespace through indentation (tabs) will makes HTML easier to read. When nesting a tag, add one tab space.

        # THE PAGE LAYOUT - Semantics

        Let's take a look at the webpage design to see how to group related elements and create a page structure:

        #HTML5 Structural Elements

        HTML5 introduced new tags to better describe blocks of content such as `<header>`, `<footer>` and `<section>`. There are many more.

        **Good for SEO** — search engines prioritize keywords used in headings and links, than keywords included in non-semantic tags like a `<div>`, so your site is more *indexable*
        
        **Good for screenreader users** - screenreaders read those tags out as the user progresses through the content, notifying them what is a header, footer, etc.

        1. Open up your `index.html` file and add a `header` tag to wrap your `h1` and `h2`
        1. Create a `main` tag and add a couple paragraphs within it. Add an `id` attribute inside the `main` tag with the value of 'content'. We will discuss why we did this a little bit later.
        1. Inside of the `main` tag, add two `section` tags and give each of them a unique `class` attribute. We will use these later to give each section their own styles with CSS
        1. Create a `footer` tag and add at least 1 paragraph inside of it.

        #Headings

        HTML heading tags define the main subjects throughout the page.

        Heading tags range from `<h1>` to `<h6>` used to describe the *hierarchy* of the page structure. To decide which heading to use, think about how you would arrange an essay outline.

        ```xml
        <h1>Types of Apples</h1>
        <h2>Red varieties</h2>
        <h3>Fuji apple</h3>
        ```

      <script type="text/template">
        #Headings

        Most screen readers allow you to skip through all headings on the page - like a table of contents - to find specific content.

        The order of headings is important as it allows non-visual users (and search engine bots) to understand the importance and hierarchy of content on the page. Heading levels should not be skipped!

        >Pro-tip: Avoid typing in uppercase letters! Some screen readers will read text in all caps letter by letter. If you want a heading to *appear* in all-caps, type it as you normally would in the HTML. We can change the *style* later with CSS!

        **Paragraphs**: whether it&#39;s one sentence or more, each paragraph needs its own pair of `<p></p>` tags:

        ```xml

        # Hyperlinks

        A hyperlink references data, such as a web page or document, that the user can follow.

        Use the anchor tag, `<a>` to create the link. It also needs an `href` attribute to provide information for the location of the resource.

        The example below includes an *absolute* path to the Ladies Learning Code homepage.

        #Paths

        Some of the content we see on a webpage lives directly within the page itself (ie. the text), but some of it may live elsewhere (eg. in the images folder, on another website, etc.).

        When we want to display some content that lives *outside* of the current page, we have to tell the browser where to find it. This information is called a `path`.

      <script type="text/template">
        #Types of Paths

        Paths allow the browser to find, retrieve, and display external resources such as images, CSS files, and even other web pages.

        There are two different types of paths:

        * `Relative` - These tell the browser how to get from the current page to the external resource.
        * `Absolute` - These tell the browser *exactly* where the external resource can be found online.

        If relative paths are like directions, an absolute path is like a home address.

        #Relative Paths

        **We use relative paths when we're trying to make a connection between two resources on the same website.**

        Relative paths start from the location of the current page, and tell the browser which folders should be looked in to find the external resource.

        ```xml
        images/backgrounds/dark/dark-background-1.jpg
        ```

        We'll be using relative paths to add images shortly!

        http://website.com/images/image-1.jpg

        // CSS
        https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.css
        ```

        Absolute paths start with a protocol (ie. `http` or `https`), followed by the location of the resource. It's usually not necessary to include the `www` before the domain.

        #Images: Self-closing tags

        Self-closing tags don't format content or require a closing tag. They are used to embed objects onto the page; they *are* the content!

        Images use a self-closing tag. It also requires the `src` *attribute* to tell the browser the location of the image file.

        ```
       <img src="images/image-file.jpg">

        ```

        `alt` is another attribute that is added to images to provide *alternative text* to visually impaired web visitors using screen readers.

        ```
        <img src="images/image-file.jpg" alt="kitten">

        ```

        The `alt` attribute is also helpful when image does not load:

          * Words like “illustration of” or “diagram of” can help provide context

        1. You can use the existing images within the `project` folder, or use images of your own. If you have images on your own site that you want to use, copy them from their current location into the `images` folder in your project. Ask a mentor if you need help!
        1. Add at least two images anywhere within your `index.html` page. Don't forget the `alt` attribute!

        ##Captions - nice to have
        Captions are text versions of audio content synchronized with video. They’re crucial for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, and can also be helpful for non-native English speakers. When captions are added to YouTube videos, they can be indexed by search engines, allowing more potential viewers to find your content.

        #Referencing CSS

        Today, we&#39;ll be creating a separate style sheet file for the CSS.  To create a stylesheet, just name the file with a `.css` file extension.

        The style sheet is then referenced within the `<head>` of the HTML document (different tag from `<header>`).

        Use `<link>` tag and two *attributes*, `rel` and `href`.

        ```
        <head>
          <title>Page Title</title>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

        * Use at least a 12-point font on all Web pages
          * Adjust the `line-height` to ensure there is a good amount of spacing between lines of text. A line-height that is too small will cause text to overlap, but a line-height that is too high can also be difficult to read.
        * Never rely on colour alone to indicate behaviour - for example, hyperlinks should be underlined

        Now that you've chosen colours that satisfy our contrast requirements, let's put them to use!

        1. Using the CSS `background` property, change the colour of your `body`, `section` or `footer` tags. Refer back to slide 72 for the syntax!
        2. Using the `color` property, change the text colour. You can select all tags of a type, like `p`, `a` or `li`. Ask a mentor to select more specific text, like only paragraphs in the footer!
        3. Change other font styles like `font-size`, `font-weight`, `text-transform` or `text-align`.

        The CSS **Box Model** describes the way CSS determines the size and spacing of HTML elements. To the browser, every HTML element is a rectangular / square box.

        In the current project HTML document, the red lines in the example below represent the outlines of all the elements.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/box-borders-example.jpg)

        Note the spacing between the elements on your page such as the headings and paragraphs. That's the default `margin` and `padding` for those elements.

        * **width** - can set a specific width

        The values for both `margin` and `padding` can be declared using 1 to 4 values, to target different sides of the element. A variety of measurement units (px, %, ems, rems, etc) can be used.

        Setting the value to "0" will *remove* any default space and any positive value will *add* space.

        Margin can also use negative values. Padding cannot.

        (Make sure the box model fix from the previous slide has been added to<!-- .element: class="note" --> **styles.css** before proceeding. Also, use the amount of space that looks good to you & use the examples below as a guide.)

        Add padding to all the portions of the page so the content is not squished to the edge and has consistent styling.

        Combine the selectors to target them all at the same time.

        ```
        header,
        section,
        footer {
          padding: 100px 150px;
        }

      <script type="text/template">
        #Class Exercise #7 - Spacing

        Notice the white space around the edge of the page? That's default space in the `body` element. Reset it by setting the values to 0.

        ```
        body {
          margin: 0;
          padding: 0;
        }
        ```

        Use `margin` to adjust the default space around the  `<h1>` and `<h2>` tag.  (You can *inspect the element* using the dev tools to see the default margin.)

        ```
        h1, h2 {
          margin: 0; /* removes default space */
        }
        ```

          font-weight: normal; /* removes default bold style */
        }

        #Descendant selectors

        Descendant selectors are used to select an element that is a descendant (nested tag) of another element.

        This is useful when targeting elements inside of a specific block of content (e.g. an `h1` in the `header`).

        Note the space in *between* each selector. This is a requirement.

        ```css
        p a {
          /* targets only anchor link tags nested inside of a p tag */
        }
        ul li a {
          /* targets a link nested in a list item in an unordered list */
        }

        #Descendant selectors

        **Pro tip!** Just like [Inception](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/), avoid going more than three levels.

        ```
        nav ul li a {
          /* NOOOOOOOOOOO */
        }
        ```

        You can skip a level but specificity rules apply.

        For example, `nav ul li a` would override `nav a` because it&#39;s more specific.

        It&#39;s generally better to start with generic selectors and make them more specific, as needed.

        # Class Exercise #9: Style the header

        Let's add some specific styles to the header, to set it apart from the rest of the page.  We can't use `h1` or `h2` by itself since it will select all of them on the page, so use *descendant selectors* instead.

        ```xml
        <header>
          <h1>Hi! I'm Laura Ipsum.</h1>
          <h2>I'm a digital designer and developer with a penchant for gourmet doughnuts.</h2>
        </header>
        ```

        ```
        header h1 {
          font-size: 100px;
        }
        header h2 {
          font-size: 32px;
        }
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Class Exercise #9: Style the header

        Next, let's highlight some keywords in the header (e.g. name).

        The semantic HTML meaning of the `<strong>` tag is to give importance to the text, so be sure to use it only for important text.

        ```
        <h1>Hi! I'm <strong>Laura Ipsum</strong>.</h1>
        <h2>I'm a digital <strong>designer</strong> and <strong>developer</strong> with a penchant for gourmet doughnuts.</h2>
        ```
        Now it can also be used to add CSS. If you want this style to be available anytime the `<strong>` tag is used, then there's no need to use a descendant selector.

        <!-- .element: class="note" -->**Pro tip!** Make sure the strong tag is used **semantically**, not just as a hook for styling!

        ```
        strong {
          color: #9D6381;
        }
        ```
        Color reference: <!-- .element: class="note" --><span style="background:#9D6381;padding:0 5px;">#9D6381</span>

        # Building a web page in blocks

        When building a web page, it's best to start with the HTML structure, then add CSS styles from general styles to more specific styles.

        But as you may have already noticed, there's no clear cut path for what to build first.  It often takes a step by step approach.

        To avoid CSS specificity issues, let's go over some general advice for using the selectors covered so far.

        #CSS Selectors: Best Practices

        **HTML element selectors:**  Use this to apply a style to all or *most* of that particular element on the page.  (e.g. all links on the page).

        ```
        a {
          color: red;
        }
        ```

        **Descendant selectors:** Use this to apply a style to a specific element within another element. (e.g. Only links within the navigation)

        ```
        nav a {
          color: blue;
        }
        ```

        **Class selectors:**  Use this to apply a style to an element that is not specific to an  HTML element, only the class.  (e.g. a portion of the page that uses the same HTML tag as another page block)

        ```
        .about {
          color: green;
        }

        #Stacked elements

        By default, most HTML elements are *block* level elements. This means they display stacked on top of each other and take up 100% width, in the order of how it is written.

        ```
        <p>element 1</p>
        <p>element 2</p>
        <p>element 3</p>
        ```
        The above HTML example renders as:

        <div class="example">
          <p>element 1</p>
          <p>element 2</p>
          <p>element 3</p>

        #Block vs Inline

        If we look at the previous box outline example again, notice that regardless of the number of characters, the content in the heading tags stack on top of each other.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/box-borders-example.jpg)
        <!-- ![](framework/img/workshop/box-borders-stack.png) -->

        Links are an example of *inline* elements, which sit side by side, in a line.  That's why you can add a link *within* a paragraph and not disrupt the flow of the text.

        #Background images

        So far, we've been using `background` to add colours but it can also be used to add background *images*.

        There are two ways to declare the `background` property.

        ```css
        /* shorthand */
        background: url(folder-name/image-file.jpg);
        ```
        ```css
        /* longhand */
        background-image: url(folder-name/image-file.jpg);
        ```
        `background` is shorthand for many different background properties.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Background images

        **Important:** Note the location of the CSS file.

        ```html
        project/
          |-- css/
              |--styles.css
          |-- images/
          |-- reference/
          |-- index.html
        ```

        Since it&#39;s inside of the **css** folder, the file path needs to reflect that.
        Use `../` to indicate that the directory needs to move *up* and *out* of the containing folder.

        ```css
        background: url(../images/image-file.jpg);
        ```

        If the image is smaller than the width of your browser window, it will repeat by default. We can change that with the `no-repeat` value like this:

        body { /* longhand */
          background-image: url(../images/buildings.jpg);
          background-repeat: no-repeat;

        Let&#39;s add the below sample code to our project, one value at a time, to see how each property works.

        ```
        body { /* longhand */
          background-image: url('../images/buildings.jpg');
          background-repeat: no-repeat;
          background-attachment: fixed;
          background-size: cover;
        }
        ```

        body { /* shorthand */
          background: url(../images/buildings.jpg) no-repeat fixed;
          background-size: cover;
        }
        ```

        ---
        ###Pro tip!

        Note that `background-size` is the longhand property. To include it in the shorthand style, it **must** be included after `background-position`, separated with the `/` character. In this case, it may be less error prone to just add it via the longhand property. More about background [here](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background/) and [here](http://www.carsonshold.com/2013/02/css-background-sizecover-doesnt-like-fixed-positioning/).

        The image adds some pizzazz but now it's hard to read the text!

        Remember RGB colour values?  Use this instead of hex or keyword values to set an opacity to a background colour.

        Most online colour resources will have all the different types of values listed, or use image editing software like Photoshop.

        Or a quick online search almost always ends up with a solution like this tool right here: <http://hex.colorrrs.com>!

        The LLC project uses <span style="background:#612940;padding:0 5px;color: white;">#612940</span> which coverts to `rgb(97,41,64)`.

        1. **Set the document language:**  Go to File > Properties > Advanced, and in the ‘Reading Options’ section select the language from the drop-down list.
        1. Prevent **security settings** from interfering with screen readers by allowing text to be copied, printed or extracted: Go to File > Properties > Security. Choose ‘No Security’ from the ‘Security Method’ drop-down list. Click OK and close the ‘Document Properties’ dialog box.
        1. If your document has more than 21 pages, **bookmarks** are required. Follow [Adobe’s guide to creating Bookmarks](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/page-thumbnails-bookmarks-pdfs.html#about_bookmarks)
        1. Ensure the document has a **high enough contrast** for users with colour blindness. Go to the Edit > Preferences, select ‘Accessibility’ in the left menu, and select the ‘Use High-Contrast colors’ option:

        1. Just like we do for images on the web, Alt Text must be applied to images used in PDFs. Follow the instructions in this guide depending on the software you are using to author the PDF.

        #Testing PDFs

        1. Once you've completed the steps on the previous slide, run an accessibility check. In the Tools tab, look for the Accessibility icon:

        1. Click on the dropdown arrow and ‘Add Shortcut’. You will now see an Accessibility item appear in the right menu. Click on that heading, and then select ‘Full Check’:

        1. In the dialogue box that appears, keep all options selected and click the ‘Start Checking’ button. A list of any issues will appear in a column on the left of the PDF. Right click on any remaining issue and select ‘Fix’ from the dropdown to resolve that issue.

      #Getting your site online

      You will need to register a domain name and purchase hosting. Here are some suggestions:

      * [dreamhost.com](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?2085384) - domains and hosting
      * [hover.com](http://hover.com/ladiescode) - domains

      Why keep your domains and hosting separate?<!-- .element: class="note" --> [Learn more about Hover](http://ladieslearningcode.com/getting-hosted-domains-with-hover/).

      You will also need to upload your files to your hosting server. You will need some info usually provided by your hosting service provider: FTP Address, Username, Password.

      Here's a tutorial getting your files online using FileZilla: [FileZilla Client Tutorial](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_Client_Tutorial_%28en%29)
