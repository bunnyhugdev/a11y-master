      ###Instructor Notes

      ###Ladies Learning Code: Building a store with Shopify

      <br>
      ##Schedule

      <strong> Important note:</strong>
      This is a guideline, not a rule! It is more important that the learners are following along then it is to get to the end of the slides!

      <em>Please note</em>: this schedule is for a single day workshop.
      If you are leading two weekday evenings, you can split this schedule up accordingly. Please remember to take a 15-30 minute break on both days. The first 15-20 minutes of the second day should be allocated for review and questions from the prior session.

      * <strong>Intro (10:00 am - 11:00 am)</strong>: Today's Goal, creating a partner count, setting up a dev store, uploading products
      * <strong>Lunch Break! (12:30 pm - 1:30 pm)</strong>
      * <strong>Wrapping it up (3:30 pm - 4:00 pm)</strong>: For-loops, snippets for pagination<br>
      Choose between Exercise #10 and the Bogus Gateway stretch goals if you have time


      <br>
      ##General Notes

      * <strong>Important!</strong> Please give learners enough time to download learner files. heck in as people are entering the room to make sure they have learner files.

      * A common issue with leaner files - make sure Windows users extract the folder. If a learner sees the slides without any styles, that is probably why.
      * To create a Partner account with Shopify, learners may be asked for PayPal information and their phone number. They will not be charged anything for the creation of the account. A Partner account is used by theme and app developers, so the PayPal information is required for them to earn money!

      Before the class starts, be sure to update the WiFi credentials on slide 1, and your instructor information on slide #112

      ##Specific Examples

      Slide 8: (What exactly is accessibility?)
      Can also include situational disabilities (eg. sprained wrist, pupils dialated for an eye exam), slow/spotty internet/data connection, people in a hurry, people with large fingers...

      Slide 13: (Perceivable)
      Can also include situational disabilities (eg. sprained wrist, pupils dialated for an eye exam), slow/spotty internet/data connection, people in a hurry, people with large fingers...

      Slide 14: (Operable)
      Take some time to go through the tab and accordion demos so people can get a visual representation of what these components are.
      You can ask people to share gripes/bad experiences they've had with content being hard or impossible to close

      Slide 17: (Accessing websites and web pages)
      You can mention that you can't share a local path with a friend, but we can talk about how to get your website "live" and online at the end of the workshop

      Slide 20:  (Software: Screen Readers)
      The box can present an opportunity to have a conversation 

      Slide 34:  (The HEAD ELEMENT)
      People can *see* your body. What is going on inside your head is integral to you being able to use your body, but people cannot see what is going on inside your head. You need to have a "peek under the hood" (view source) to see what is in the <head> element

      Slide 38:  (Class Exercise #1: Editing your project's HTML page)
      Let the learners do this exercise without you leading them. They can work with their mentors and the people around them. Feel free to walk around and help if people get stuck.

      Slide 41:  (Class Exercise #2: Structure)
      Walk the learners through this exercise. Let them try to do #4 on their own.

      Slide 47:  (PARAGRAPHS)
      Be sure to clarify the 1st box is the good example, the 2nd box it the bad one. People may not be able to see the colour difference!

      Slide 70:  (CSS: The presentation layer)
      Underscore why we have taken so much time on building a foundation with quality HTML markup. Some visually impaired users will not experience the layout, colours or background imagery we will be applying with CSS

      Slide 71:  (CSS Syntax & Terminology)
      Note the American spelling of the word 'colour'.
      Take the time to go through the last question on this slide and make sure it is clear before moving on

      Slide 81:  (CSS FONT STYLES)
      Explain what each property does while updating each example in the code editor. Talk about the difference between using line-height with and without a measurement unit.

      Refer back to when we advised headings not to be spelled in the HTML in all-caps. We can use this text-transform property to change the style of headings into uppercase!

      Slide 96:  (MARGIN AND PADDING)
      Encourage them to use the long-hand today since it's easier to understand. If they want to try the short hand, use comments to refer back to later

      Slide xx: Background images
      This is often a point of confusion for learners. Show them the relationship between files and folders in Atom, and then again in your File Explorer/Finder. Point to the files on the projector to be as clear as possible.
